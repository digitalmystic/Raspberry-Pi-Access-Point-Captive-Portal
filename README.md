# Raspberry Pi

*Setup your Raspberry Pi as an Access Point and Captive Portal*

---

## Objective

You've experienced the Captive Portal process before. You walk into Starbucks, join the WiFi, get a popup asking you to join, accept, get some home page with information.

Ever wanted to **roll your own**, today, you'll learn how.

Follow along with the additional readme files in the following order:

* [Access Point](https://github.com/32teeth/Raspberry-Pi-Access-Point-Captive-Portal/blob/master/Raspberry%20Pi%20-%20Access%20Point.md)
* [Server Stack](https://github.com/32teeth/Raspberry-Pi-Access-Point-Captive-Portal/blob/master/Raspberry%20Pi%20-%20Apache%20MySQL%20PHP%20Wordpress.md)
* [Virtual Servers](https://github.com/32teeth/Raspberry-Pi-Access-Point-Captive-Portal/blob/master/Raspberry%20Pi%20-%20Virtual%20Hosts.md)

Additionally, you'll need to create some additional configurations for activating the Captive Portal portion of this experience. For now, you'll have enough to go on.
